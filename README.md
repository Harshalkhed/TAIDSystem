# TAIDSystem
We have created a Thyroid algorithm and Influenza system, which would not only detect the thyroid diseases but also, general influenza diseases present around us. Due to the vast improvement in computer science and especially medical field we have developed this algorithm for doctors so that they can easily detect thyroid and prescribe medicines accordingly.
Here it will not only make this process computerized but also make it user-friendly and less time consuming for the doctors who will be able to attend more patients and detect thyroid and influenza at ease.
Here we have three modules
1. Thyroid Algorithm
2. Doctor
3. Patient
Here the doctor is the admin and he has the authority to add diseases and their synonyms, generate reports, and provide prescription. And the role of the patient is to just tell his/her symptoms to the doctor provide necessary basic information to them.
It makes convenient for the doctors to know the symptoms from remote place even if he is not in person seeing his patient. And here the doctor himself is given authority for prescription.
